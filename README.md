## What is this module for?
This is a boilerplate for all the upcoming npm expirements!! :D

This is brand new, not ready for production unless you are ready and willing to contribute to the project. Building something we want here, if it interests you, please help :)

Also, it has no tests. No seriously, it's awesome.
